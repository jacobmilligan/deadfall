# Deadfall

Inspired by retro themed rogue-like games such as Dwarf Fortress and free-form survival-esque games like Minecraft, Deadfall is a game centred around exploring and surviving in a unique, procedurally generated world - a slice of a mysterious land name Deadfall. The main goal is to find treasure and sell it on the item market while staving off hunger and avoiding death.

## Features

* Large, procedurally generated maps with several biomes
* Hunger and health
* Rabbits to hunt with your fists
* Treasure to find and sell
* A simulated in-game economy with price and demand fluctuations

## Installing

Deadfall is mac only at the moment but there are plans to make it cross-platform. You can either build it from source by cloning the repository and running the ``build.sh`` script in the command line or downloading a ``.zip`` of the current release under the releases tab.

To build from source you need the latest version of [**Free Pascal Compiler**](http://www.freepascal.org/) and all accompanying resource files in order to compile the game.

## Contributing

The source is fairly self-explanatory and well-commented so feel free to contribute!
